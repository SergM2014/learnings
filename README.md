today is 4th of februar 2017 .Starting learning-training site with
thema -> learning resource Center, prototype for this my attempt is
laracasts.com
Piculiarities:
only subscribed user can watch and download lesson, make comments. unsubsribed user can watch lesson only with 
free status.
Also advanced admin part is present with stratification of admins.
design is fully responsible. No bootstrap , but my own classes.
only payment system is absent.

subscribed user for testing
login:admin        password:admin
      superadmin            superadmin
      admin                 admin
      111111                111111
      
      
admins with roles and passwords 
login:superadmin        pasword:superadmin   role:superadmin
      admin                     admin             admin
      user                      user              user
